# Airwallex Payment Demo

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how [Airwallex payment element](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airwallex-payment-elements) can be integrated with different web frameworks. Demos in each framework demonstrate each of the various payment acceptance methods merchants can use.

Our goal is to make it easy for you (Merchants) to use our platform, as easy as a copy-paste!
